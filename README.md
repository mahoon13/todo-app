this is my first nextjs app so i dont focus on styles.

## What i learned ##
- Create **Basic API Routes** in nextjs
- Use **MongoDB** as database
- Working with **useReducer()** hook in ReactJS
- Implement **Simple Drag And Drop** for list items(todos) to rearrange them
- Implement Very Simple **userless auth**(its my first app with auth so its not good and needs update)

## TODO ##
- [ ] rewrite auth system
- [ ] work on styles
